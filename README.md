# What is HTML?
HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a webpage using elements represented by tags. These elements allow you to define headers, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and much more, making HTML the backbone of web content.

# Key Features of HTML:
Tags and Elements: HTML documents are made up of elements that are represented by tags. These tags define the structure and content of the webpage.

# Attributes:
Tags can have attributes that provide additional information about an element. For example, the <input> tag uses attributes like type, name, and placeholder to define input fields in forms.

# Forms and Inputs: 
HTML forms are crucial for user interaction on the web. The <form> tag, combined with various input types like text, password, checkbox, radio button, and more, allows users to submit data to a server.
